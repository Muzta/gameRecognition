Game Recognition
================
This is a project of image classification, which you can train your own model using ResNets (Residual Networks) or deploy our simple web application.
We classified gampley shots of different videogames, so you can use our scrapping code too.

ResNet Training
===============
The following instructions must be made in the folder resnetMiPropioDataset:

```bash
cd resnetMiPropioDataset
```

Scrapping
---------
First, you must configurate the file extractDatabase.py options:

```python
DATASETNAME = 'your_dataset_name' #It'll be created in the folder datasets/
NIMAGES = 2 
LINKSFILEPATH = os.path.join('extractImages','your_extraction_file.txt') #The path of your extraction file
```

Then run it:
```bash
python extractDatabase.py
```

Extraction file
---------------
It must have the next format:

```
name, url, startMoment[Optional], endMoment[Optional] 
...

name(str): The name you would like for your images. It will be your class name.
url(str): The URL of the video where the images are taken.
startMoment(str): Moment of the video when start recording. Follow the formats: HH:MM:SS / MM:SS / SS .
endMoment(str): Moment of the video when end recording. Follow the formats: HH:MM:SS / MM:SS / SS .
```
You can find an example in extractImages/datasetVideoLinks.txt

Training a model
----------------

Run the file trainer.py:

```bash
python trainer.py [-m --model] [-d --dataset]


required arguments:

-m --model      Path and name where the model will be stored.
-d --dataset    Path of the dataset. Must be a file system with the structure: datasetName->className->[Images].

```

There are more configuration options in the source code:
```python

BATCH = 32 #Batch size
EPOCHS = 100 
ACCURACY = 1 #Stopping validation. Accuracy over trainning data
LOSS = 0 #Stopping validation. Loss over trainning data

```

Also, you can change your network at line 72:

```python
# You can use ResNet34, ResNet50 or ResNet101
model = ResNet101.build(numChannels=3, imgRows=224, ...

```

Test the model
--------------

To check the preformance of your model, you can run the modelTest.py file:

```bash
python modelTest.py [-m --model] [-d --dataset] [-w --width] [--e --height]


required arguments:

-m --model      Path of the model to check
-d --dataset    Name of the dataset in the folder datasets

optionals arguments:

-w --width      Widh of the model intput images (default = 224)
--e --height    Height of the model intput images (default = 224)
```

Before running it, you must modify the array 'labelNames' in the source code and set the classes of your model. You can find it at line 65:

```python
labelNames = numpy.array(['Deathloop', 'It takes two', ...
```

This method gives details for each image in de dataset, so itÂ´s recommended using a small and controlled dataset.


Website deployment
==================

You can deploy locally your app with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)

```bash
cd website
flask run
```

The deployment can be made with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) too.

When it's installed, you can run the app with the command:

```bash
cd website
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 muzta/game-recognition
```

To use your own model, put it in the folder website/model. 
Then, change the name in the source code of the file website/app.py at line 30:

```python
model = os.path.join(path,'website','models',"yourModel")
```

Also, you must change the class names at line 79:

```python
    labelNames = np.array(['Deathloop', 'It takes two', ...
```
